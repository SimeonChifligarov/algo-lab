# big-o-and-analysis

## Goal
Build intuition for Big-O (time/space complexity) and back it up with a tiny, runnable tool that *measures* runtimes and fits them against common growth models (1, log n, n, n log n, n², n³).

## What you’ll learn
- How to reason about asymptotic growth (ignoring constants, focusing on dominant terms)
- Common complexity classes and when they show up
- The gap between theory and measurement (overheads, caches, constant factors)
- How to do lightweight benchmarking without fooling yourself
